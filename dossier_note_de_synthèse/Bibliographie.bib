	abstract = {Analyzing the impact of climate variables into the operational planning processes is essential for the robust implementation of a sustainable power system. This paper deals with the modeling of the run-of-river hydropower production based on climate variables on the European scale. A better understanding of future run-of-river generation patterns has important implications for power systems with increasing shares of solar and wind power. Run-of-river plants are less intermittent than solar or wind but also less dispatchable than dams with storage capacity. However, translating time series of climate data (precipitation and air temperature) into time series of run-of-river-based hydropower generation is not an easy task as it is necessary to capture the complex relationship between the availability of water and the generation of electricity. This task is also more complex when performed for a large interconnected area. In this work, a model is built for several European countries by using machine learning techniques. In particular, we compare the accuracy of models based on the Random Forest algorithm and show that a more accurate model is obtained when a finer spatial resolution of climate data is introduced. We then discuss the practical applicability of a machine learning model for the medium term forecasts and show that some very context specific but influential events are hard to capture.},

	abstract = {Efficient detection of refrigerant leakage is of utmost importance for industrial refrigeration systems due to its
potential to cause substantial impacts on system performance and the environment. Existing research on fault
detection and diagnosis in refrigeration systems primarily revolves around solutions based on experimental or
laboratory data. However, in the industrial use case, achieving accurate and early detection poses significant
challenges. This paper reports on the development of a novel refrigerant leak detection method for industrial
vapor compression refrigeration systems. Our method leverages real-world data obtained from operational
installations, enabling us to assess its reliability and applicability. The proposed data-driven approach involves
predicting the fault-free liquid level in the installation receiver and comparing the actual and predicted levels.
In this work, we place emphasis on features and model selection. Dedicated metrics combined with a model
comparison method are proposed to evaluate and compare the performance of commonly used regression
models with two sets of features to determine the most effective one. Furthermore, we provide insights into
the results obtained from the deployment of the proposed method in real-world industrial installations.},
